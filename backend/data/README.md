- [ ] Update webhook endpoint to production URL

- **invoice.payment_failed**: Marks subscription as past due
- **subscription.trial_will_end**: Sends trial ending notification

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid price ID" error**
   - Verify price IDs in `.env` match those in Stripe Dashboard
   - Ensure you're using the correct test/live keys

2. **Webhook signature verification failed**
   - Check webhook secret in `.env`
   - Ensure webhook URL is accessible
   - Verify HTTPS in production

3. **Subscription not updating in app**
   - Check webhook endpoint is receiving events
   - Verify database connection
   - Check server logs for errors
