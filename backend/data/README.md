# Backend Data Directory

This directory contains JSON files used for data storage in development mode.

Files:
- `users.json` - User accounts and authentication data
- `profiles.json` - User profile information
- `wallets.json` - User wallet balances
- `wallet-transactions.json` - Wallet transaction history
- `events.json` - Event data (if needed for persistence)

Note: In production, these would be replaced with a proper database.
